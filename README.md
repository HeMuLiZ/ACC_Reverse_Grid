- This app works only with Windows. Only Win10 tested.
- If you haven't already done so, you'll need to manually modify an entrylist, sessions, and other server settings before using this application.
  This application only changes the sessions and defaultGridPosition values of the entry list. It can't add drivers in the entrylist.
- You need to attach all the files next to where you have server.exe, cfg- and results folders. That's it, you can use app now.
- Server restart needed after any changes.
